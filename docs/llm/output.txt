Description     : Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
                : conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
                : compilation to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".
                : The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
                : about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
                : calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
                : is found.
